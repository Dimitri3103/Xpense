## Remi's notes

- We will look for a nice tool that help us to maintain technical doc up to date with low friction
- Markdown/Jekyll style
- Tried [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) (VS Code extension)
  - Can export as HTML/PDF/all
  - has a CLI (perfect for CI/CD integration)
  - Can build doc page using jekyll
  - Nice tool, but should be adopted widely by the team to be useful
